The [International Standard Classification of Occupations](https://ilostat.ilo.org/methods/concepts-and-definitions/classification-occupation/) (ISCO) is a system developed by the [International Labour Organisation](https://www.ilo.org/) (ILO) to classify and categorize occupations worldwide. It provides a standardized framework for organizing and comparing information about occupations across different countries and regions.
